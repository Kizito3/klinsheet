                    <p>YES! We run physical guarantor checks. We usually meet up with guarantors in their homes or offices. By and large, we prefer to meet up with guarantors at their place of work as this helps us to gather more information about who they really are vis-a-vis who they say they are.</p>

                        <p>Usually, academic certificate verifications take between 4 - 6 weeks in most schools in Nigeria. Howbeit, there are cases where results are delayed due to strikes and other academic issues that might result in schools not being open for some time. Other than these, our reports are delivered latest 6 weeks from the date of request.</p>
